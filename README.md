              The system should enable teachers to take attendance, record absences, and generate attendance reports easily.
              Additionally, it should allow students and parents to access attendance records, view their attendance history, and receive notifications regarding their attendance status.

              By tracking attendance, educators can identify students who are struggling and provide the necessary support to help them stay on track. 
              Additionally, attendance management systems can help schools and colleges comply with regulatory requirements and reduce truancy rates.
              Moreover, an attendance management system website for schools or colleges can improve communication between parents, students, and educators. 
              Parents can monitor their children's attendance records and receive timely updates on their attendance status. 
              Students can also take responsibility for their attendance and improve their academic performance by regularly attending classes.
              Overall, the vision of an attendance management system website for schools or colleges is to create a more engaged, accountable, and successful learning environment for all students.
